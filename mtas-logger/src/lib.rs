/// This function is intended to be called exactly once at application start (e.g. in main)
/// before any logging occurs. It installs a global default subscriber.

/// The returned WorkerGuard MUST be kept alive (not dropped) for as long as you want
/// logging to function correctly. Dropping it will stop the background logging worker
/// and may cause log events to be lost.
///
/// Typical usage:
/// let _guard = mtas_logger::set_logger(std::io::stdout())?;
/// (Store `_guard` in a variable you keep until shutdown; using a leading underscore
/// silences unused warnings while still preserving the guard.)
